I’m Jia Jiang, a postdoctoral researcher at MIT specializing in wildfire emissions, atmospheric chemistry, and air quality modeling. My current work focuses on advancing our understanding of wildfire smoke chemistry and how smoke exposure affects air quality, public health, and vulnerable communities.

My expertise lies in chemical mechanism development, air quality modeling, and data integration. My research spans a wide range of wildfire-related processes: from developing detailed emission speciation profiles to building chemical mechanisms for underrepresented biomass burning gases such as phenols, furans, and monoterpenes. I’ve modeled how these compounds form secondary pollutants like ozone and organic aerosols, and evaluated their contributions to health risks and environmental justice disparities.

My goal is to improve our ability to predict, assess, and mitigate the impacts of wildfire smoke using science-based, scalable tools. I aim to connect advanced chemical modeling with real-world decision-making, supporting faster, more targeted responses to wildfire events in a changing climate.
