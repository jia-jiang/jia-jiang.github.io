## Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Feb 2024 - Present)
### Postdoctoral Associate 
 * Evaluated monoterpene oxidation chemistry in CRACMM, emphasizing the critical role of PANs.
 * Developed a chemical speciation algorithm to convert high-resolution lab data into model-ready formats. 
 * Built a relational database and automated ETL pipeline linking lab data with chemical models.
 * Created an open-source Python/SQLite toolkit to support chemical mechanism development.

## University of California, Davis (Jan 2022 - Dec 2023)
### Postdoctoral Associate 
 * Led source-oriented simulations of PM and ozone exposure from wildfire and animal agriculture emissions under future energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) scenarios for CARB and USDA projects.
 * Developed a wildfire speciation profile expanding CARB’s wood combustion inventory from 14 to 72 reactive organic gas species, improving air toxics and health risk modeling resolution.
 * Applied data fusion techniques combining EPA monitoring stations, PurpleAir sensors, in-situ meteorological observations, and satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) data using a random forest approach. Reduced model bias and improved forecast accuracy for wildfire smoke exposure and key pollutants.
 * Calculated public health co-benefits and environmental justice (EJ) metrics from GHG mitigation strategies in support of environmental justice goals under CEQA.

## University of California, Riverside (Sep 2016 - Dec 2021)
### Graduate Student Researcher 
 * Designed and analyzed environmental chamber experiments to investigate secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and ozone formation from wildfire VOCs. 
 * Built detailed oxidation mechanisms for wildfire-relevant VOCs (furans, phenols and monoterpenes) using the SAPRC mechanism generator (MechGen), and implemented them into air quality models to improve simulation accuracy for EPA- and NSF-funded projects.
### Teaching Assistant
 * Led discussion sections and provided MATLAB support for the course “Engineering Modeling and Analysis”, and graded assignments and exams (~100 students).

## University of California, Irvine (Oct 2015 - May 2016)
### Volunteer Researcher 
 * Collaborated with GIS and computer science teams to develop a risk assessment framework for water system vulnerability by analyzing pipe failure data in relation to extreme weather patterns.

## Taizhou Meteorological Bureau (Jul 2014 - Aug 2015)
### Meteorologist
 * Delivered short- and long-term county-level weather forecasts, combining surface observations with radar, satellite imagery, and model guidance.
 * Communicated real-time warnings and briefings to local media and emergency response teams during typhoons and weather events, helping the public prepare and respond.

## Zhejiang University (Sep 2011 - Jun 2014)
### Graduate Student Researcher 
 * Classified Pacific tropical cyclones based on formation patterns using large-scale circulation and gridded datasets.
 * Leveraged gridded meteorological datasets and satellite products to trace the evolution of initial disturbances into tropical cyclones.
 * Used WRF, satellite, and in situ data to study terrain impacts on mesoscale precipitation and wind systems.
 * Applied data assimilation techniques to enhance model inputs and produce more accurate.
### Teaching Assistant
 * Delivered lectures twice a week and hands-on WRF model labs for the course “Numerical Weather Forecast” (~20 students).
