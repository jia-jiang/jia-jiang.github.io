## Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Feb 2024 - Present)
### Postdoctoral Associate 
Bridge laboratory research and atmospheric modeling through the development of open-source tools that streamline the integration of oxidation chemistry data into regulatory air quality models.
* Designed a scalable ETL pipeline and relational database architecture to convert high-resolution lab measurements into mechanism-ready formats in CMAQ.
* Created a modular Python/SQLite toolkit to support mechanism developers, facilitating data-driven updates to models.

## University of California, Davis (Jan 2022 - Dec 2023)
### Postdoctoral Associate 
Directed environmental modeling efforts to evaluate the air quality impacts of wildfire smoke and GHG emissions.
* Developed an expanded wildfire VOC speciation profile, increasing chemical resolution to improve the prediction of air toxics and population-level exposure during wildfire events.
* Built Random Forest machine learning models that integrated data from low-cost sensors, satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD), and WRF-based meteorological forecasts.
* Led scenario-based simulations to assess the air quality, health, and environmental justice (EJ) co-benefits of manure management strategies under future climate mitigation scenarios.

## University of California, Riverside (Sep 2016 - Dec 2021)
### Graduate Student Researcher 
Advanced atmospheric chemical mechanism development to strengthen air quality modeling.
* Investigated ozone and SOA formation under wildfire conditions by integrating high-resolution laboratory data with computational chemistry, improving the mechanistic understanding of pollutant generation.
* Developed detailed oxidation mechanisms for biomass-burning VOCs, using the SAPRC mechanism generation system (MechGen), filling gaps in existing chemical models.
### Teaching Assistant
* Led discussion sections and provided MATLAB support for the course “Engineering Modeling and Analysis”, and graded assignments and exams (~100 students).

## University of California, Irvine (Oct 2015 - May 2016)
### Volunteer Researcher 
* Collaborated with GIS and computer science teams to evaluate the resilience of water systems under climate stressors.
* Conducted the analysis of historical pipe failure data in relation to extreme weather events.

## Taizhou Meteorological Bureau (Jul 2014 - Aug 2015)
### Meteorologist
* Produced county-level forecasts by integrating surface observations, radar, satellite imagery, and numerical weather prediction models.
* Issued warnings and briefings to media and emergency teams during typhoons and extreme weather, enhancing local preparedness.

## Zhejiang University (Sep 2011 - Jun 2014)
### Graduate Student Researcher 
Conducted numerical weather modeling and data analysis to study tropical cyclone formation and terrain-influenced mesoscale weather systems in East Asia.
* Analyzed large-scale circulation patterns and satellite data to classify and track the development of tropical cyclones over the Pacific Ocean.
* Investigated orographic effects on precipitation and wind patterns using WRF simulations, satellite observations, and in situ measurements.
* Applied data assimilation techniques to improve model accuracy for mesoscale forecasting applications.
### Teaching Assistant
* Delivered lectures twice a week and hands-on WRF model labs for the course “Numerical Weather Forecast” (~20 students).
