summary: "Anaerobic digesters on California dairy farms can significantly reduce methane emissions with minimal impact on air quality. Modeling for the year 2050 in the San Joaquin Valley shows slight changes in PM2.5 and ozone levels, negligible health risks, and no effect on environmental justice disparities, supporting digesters as a low-risk GHG reduction strategy."

## Description
The dairy industry in California emits large amounts of methane (CH4) that contributes significantly to the state’s overall Greenhouse Gas (GHG) budget.  Reducing CH4 emissions has become a key priority for dairy farms in support of California’s GHG reduction goals. Anaerobic digesters designed to capture CH4 from animal manure present a practical option for reducing CH4 emissions, but a comprehensive evaluation of the local air quality impacts of this technology has not been previously undertaken.

The simplest digester configurations decrease local emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) but increase emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx), potentially changing local air quality.  Here, we evaluate the air quality implications of widespread digester adoption in the year 2050 across the San Joaquin Valley (SJV) in central California, which is home to the highest concentration of dairy farms in the state.  

Our research results indicate that baseline dairy emissions make minor contributions to air pollutant concentrations in 2050. A health impact analysis shows that the widespread use of dairy digesters would result in fewer than 0.1 additional deaths per 100,000 people due to changing air pollution. For comparison, this level of mortality change is more than 100 times smaller than the risk posed by seasonal flu.  Further, Environmental Justice analysis indicates that the implementation of digesters will not influence the exposure disparities among different racial groups in either the SJV or the surrounding San Francisco Bay & Sacramento area. 

These findings suggest that dairy digesters can be widely adopted in central California to reduce GHG emissions with minimal effect on regional air quality and public health.
