## Description
The increase in the frequency, extent, and duration of wildfires has become a great concern for air quality and climate because of the significant quantities of trace gases released from wildfires. Recent advances in analytical techniques have improved the identification and quantification of gas-phase wildfire emissions, yet the atmospheric chemistry of many VOCs remains poorly understood and inadequately represented in air quality models.

Certain classes of wildfire-derived VOCs, such as heterocyclic compounds, oxygenated aromatics, and monoterpenes, are known precursors to ozone (O3) and secondary organic aerosol (SOA), but their reaction pathways are not well characterized. To address this gap, this project used the Statewide Air Pollution Research Center (SAPRC) modeling system to develop and evaluate new gas-phase chemical mechanisms for key VOCs, including furans and phenols, and their major oxidation products.

Mechanisms were derived using a combination of published experimental data, molecular modeling, and estimates from SAPRCâ€™s Mechanism Generation System (MechGen). These mechanisms were implemented in the SAPRC box model and evaluated against observations of VOC reactivity, nitric oxide (NO) decay, O3 formation, and radical levels. Notably, the mechanisms were developed without tuning to fit the evaluation data, but still demonstrated significantly improved model performance.

This work advances our understanding of wildfire VOC chemistry and helps close gaps in chemical mechanism representation. It also marks the first use of MechGen to connect gas-phase chemistry with SOA formation, enhancing its estimation methodology and increasing its visibility and accessibility within the atmospheric chemistry community.
