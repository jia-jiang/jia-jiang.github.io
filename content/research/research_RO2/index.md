summary: "Chamber-derived secondary organic aerosol (SOA) yields from camphene are reported here for the first time. The influence of peroxy radicals (RO2) was investigated using chemically detailed box models. Notably, this study is the first to show that low concentrations of NO can enhance the formation of oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs) in the atmosphere."

## Description
While camphene is one of the dominant monoterpenes measured in biogenic and pyrogenic emissions samples, oxidation of camphene has not been well-studied in environmental chambers and very little is known about its potential to form secondary organic aerosol (SOA). The lack of chamber-derived SOA data for camphene may lead to significant uncertainties in predictions of SOA from oxidation of monoterpenes using existing parameterizations when camphene is a significant contributor to total monoterpenes. 

Therefore, to advance the understanding of camphene oxidation and SOA formation, and to improve representation of camphene in air quality models, a series of experiments were performed in the University of California Riverside environmental chamber to explore camphene SOA mass yields and properties across a range of chemical conditions at atmospherically relevant OH concentrations. 

In this project, the experimental results were compared with modeling simulations obtained using two chemically detailed box models, Statewide Air Pollution Research Center (SAPRC) and Generator for Explicit Chemistry and Kinetics of Organics in the Atmosphere (GECKO-A). SOA parameterizations were derived from the chamber data using both the two-product and volatility basis set (VBS) approaches. 

Experiments performed with added nitrogen oxides (NOx) resulted in higher SOA mass yields (up to 64%) than experiments performed without added NOx (up to 28%). In addition, camphene SOA mass yields increased with SOA mass (Mo) at lower mass loadings, but a threshold was reached at higher mass loadings in which the SOA mass yields no longer increased with Mo. 

SAPRC modeling of the chamber studies suggested that the higher SOA mass yields at higher initial NOx levels were primarily due to higher production of peroxy radicals (RO2) and the generation of highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs) formed through unimolecular RO2 reactions. SAPRC predicted that in the presence of NOx, camphene RO2 reacts with NO and the resultant RO2 undergo hydrogen (H)-shift isomerization reactions; as has been documented previously, such reactions rapidly add oxygen and lead to products with very low volatility (i.e., HOMs).
