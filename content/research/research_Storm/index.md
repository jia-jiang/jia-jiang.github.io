## Description
Severe convective weather is characterized by its localized scale, rapid onset, and significant societal impacts, making it a persistent challenge in both operational forecasting and atmospheric research. Zhejiang Province, located in a mid-latitude hilly region along China’s eastern coast, is especially susceptible to such events due to complex synoptic circulations, land-sea contrasts, and diverse terrain.

This project analyzed major convective events from 2010 to 2012 to characterize the spatial distribution of severe convection across Zhejiang. Statistical analysis over the three-year period revealed a clear correlation between convective activity and the province’s topographic features.

To further examine the underlying mechanisms, WRF model simulations were conducted to assess the roles of latent heat release and terrain in southeastern Zhejiang. Results indicate that, without latent heat feedback from precipitation, the region lacks sufficient thermal and dynamic support for initiating severe convection. In contrast, the presence of coastal mountains enhances atmospheric instability and promotes vertical motion, facilitating convective development.
